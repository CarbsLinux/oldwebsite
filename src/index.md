Carbs Linux is an in-development LinuxÂ® distribution with a suckless mindset.
The system will consist of only the necessary programs to create a Linux
distribution.

Package Manager
---------------

Carbs Linux is built upon the world's best Linux distribution 
[KISS Linux](https://getkiss.org) and uses [kiss](https://github.com/kisslinux/kiss)
as its package manager, which has proven to be extremely flexible. I aim to move Carbs
to an even more suckless path.


Sane defaults
-------------

By default, Carbs Linux comes with busybox for coreutils, runit as the system 
supervisor, and sinit as the init, though nothing holds you from changing any
of them.

**Busybox update reqires manual intervention**

The new busybox package conflicts with the pre-update busybox-init. That's why
you should rebuild and install `busybox-init` before doing the update.

<pre><code>
# Do a kiss update first (but don't actually update it yet), or manually pull the git repository
$ kiss u  # Cancel this operation after it asks for you to confirm the update

# Install the busybox-init package
$ kiss b busybox-init && kiss i busybox-init

# Continue your update as you normally would.
$ kiss u

</code></pre>

I have moved runit and logging utilities from the busybox-init package to the busybox
package, which is the cause of these conflicts.
