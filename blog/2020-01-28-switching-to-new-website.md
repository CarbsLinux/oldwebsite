## Switching to New Website

**Date:** Jan 28 2020

In case you haven't seen it before, this website
was powered by [werc](http://werc.cat-v.org). And
even though I liked it really much, it was too
powerful for a small website like this. 

So I have decided to reimplement this website with 
my own static generation scripts. The source will
probably be on <https://carbslinux.org/git/website/log.html>
when I decide to publish the website.

The generation requires Plan9 programs, although
I have used them just for my enthusiasm. I have built
the site with a combination of mk (instead of make), rc, 
and POSIX sh. I am not yet exactly familiar with rc, 
but I will replace the shell scripts when I feel like 
I can.
